# Spotify-self-analysis
"This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook project that analyzes my own Spotify artist profile data and compares it to other artists of interest. 
The project includes data extraction, analysis, and the creation of an artist recommendation system using Python. The results of the analysis and the recommendation system are based on the audio features and other attributes . The project provides a unique and personalized approach to exploring new artists and discovering music on Spotify."
